Python_RPG_Game
==========

Hello, this is a game that I have wanted to make since I started programming, actually, it was one of the reasons I started to program. This uses Classes, too many in my opinion, but that way I can make edits to any entity when I wish, and if I wish.

I would appreciate people saying how I can improve my code, I mostly want it to be pythonic, and fast.
